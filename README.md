# PalalaPHP

It's a soon-to-be-released view framework that's built for reading markdown content  and displaying it into html, with a simple template layout system that can be customized to your needs.

## What it is NOT

- It is not a static site generator

## What is it for?

- Sites with html content (ie blogposts, personal wikis, knowledgebase, FAQ, news sites)
- If you need to be able to add site contents to version control. 
- If you have a server that can render with PHP
- Sensible default components - nav, contact form, order form (for simple order X sites)


## Who is it intended for?

- PHP developers who need a static-like website but have the option to use PHP in the code. 
- People who like markdown, and like PHP, and want to use both in a website 

## Why use this, this is similar to jigsaw. 

Yes, there are static generators like jigsaw and sculpin, and then those can be deployed on netlify or vercel.

My main reason fo rmaking this is  to be  customizable as possible and as simple as possible, the average non-Laravel or non-static site user can still understand how to use it, and grok how it works.

Jigsaw is my inspiration for this, it uses blade though. I prefer to use [Native PHP templates](https://PlatesPHP.com).
